My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

Grow deeper in my faith and stay consistent with my personal devotion and spiritual discipline.
Improve my CAD and simulation skills, especially in Fusion 360, by working on more hands-on design projects.
Strengthen my understanding of core mechanical engineering courses through steady study habits and revision.
Build or contribute to at least one meaningful engineering project that solves a real problem.
Develop better time management so I can balance school, personal growth, and rest without burnout.
Engage more intentionally in communities that support my growth, both academically and spiritually.
Continue nurturing healthy relationships with my family and friends.
