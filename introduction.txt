Brief Introduction About Myself

Hi. I'm Anu. I’m the kind of person who can read for hours without noticing time passing, yet somehow I also come alive at night like that’s when my brain finally clocks in. I listen to music a lot, including the kind people raise eyebrows at because it sounds a little too experimental. My family is a whole story: a strict but playful mum who can switch from scolding to laughing in seconds, a calm and kind dad who balances everything out, and a last-born sister who is both annoying and somehow still my favorite person. All of that is part of me, but the biggest thing that defines me is my faith. It shapes how I move, how I think, and how I love people.
 
 My interest in engineering comes from that same mindset. I enjoy understanding how things work and finding ways to make them work better. I’ve spent the past few years learning through hands-on experience in robotics, CAD design, and mechanical systems. I like working on projects where I can build, test, and refine ideas into something useful. Engineering feels like a practical way to solve problems and create solutions that have real impact.
